## About

This project is an example of homepage of a website that is hosting recipes.
The interface should give the user friendly cards in which they can see the
image, name and link for a recipe.

## Installation

This project is using Vite to manage the files and create a development
environment with web server and hot update. To use it, follow these steps:

- install `NodeJS` (a javascript runtime for desktop) and a package manager for the Javascript libraries such as `npm` (that may come built-in with NodeJS) or `yarn`.
  - If you are a Windows user, you can download an installer in the official [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
  - If you are a Linux user, you can probably find those as packages in your distro's package manager, such as `apt` or `pacman` or as an [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/node). They might be separately. In any case, you can still download their binaries in the same website as Windows users and add them to the system's `$PATH` variable.
- Download this repository: you can do it using `git` by using the command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f1redr4g0n/recipedia.git
```
or you can download it as a `zip` file in the GitHub page.

- Access the project's folder in a terminal emulator.
- Use `npm` to install its dependencies by using

```bash
npm i
```

- You can, then, open a web server to preview the page using `vite` by running the npm script `dev` by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can stop the development server by hitting `Ctrl + C` or closing your terminal.
